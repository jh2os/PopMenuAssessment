__*There could be a level of abstraction between the idea of the "Menu" and the categories/sub-menus. It would offer the ability to manage MenuFlare and MenuNotes at the top level of a menu. In thinking about possible front-end implementations of managing a menu, I believe the abstraction can be largely resolved through a separate menu interface and by possibly adding them from the menuItem level. By keeping the notes and flare menu agnostic it would allow for global implementations across different menus like a drink or desert menu. So the top menu is actually just another instance of a sub-menu with no parent.*__
