## Level 1 Object ideation
#### MenuItem: (class):

>    MenuItem is to hold all information regarding a food item. Name, description, an image (or multiples?), portion sizes and prices, calorie information, special identifiers (hot seller, GF, Vegan, etc...), and footnotes (meat warning, egg warning, etc..).

Basic Data Types:
* Name (text)
* Description (textarea)
* Image (text link)

Complex Types:
* Images (array)
  * ImageFileName (text)


* Portions (array)
  * Price (number)
  * Portion size (text)
  * Calories for this portion (text)


* MenuStickers (object hash): collection of MenuStickers that apply to item

>**Note: A Flare and Notes class will have to be created.**
>
>**Update: on second thought menu flare and menu notes can be in the same model and you could just flag them as note/flare/etc... This also allows for adding additional data types**
>
>
>#### ~~~MenuFlare: (class):~~~
>
>~~Menu Flare are icons or flags that can be applied to MenuItems such as Gluten Free, Vegan, >Specials, Favorites ect...~~
>
>#### ~~~MenuNotes: (class)~~~
>~~Menu notes will contain all the footnotes that are printed at the bottom of menus.~~

#### MenuSticker

> A catchall data class for applying image/key stickers and notes to a menu item like Vegan, Gluten Free, Hot Seller, and food warning notes. See note and update above ^

Basic Data:
* Footnote text (text)
* Footnote symbol/image (text) (e.g. â€  â€¡ *, ðŸŒ¾, "images/icon.svg" )
* category name (text) - keeping this just text allows for extension in the future


#### Menu: (class)
> Menu possibly contains reference to a list of other menus (category). If there are no more categories then it would contain selected menu items (MenuItem). It can also contain description information

Basic Data:
* Menu Description
* Parent

Complex Types:
* Sub-menus (array) [Menu]
* Menu Items (array) [MenuItem]


__*There could be a level of abstraction between the idea of the "Menu" and the categories/sub-menus. It would offer the ability to manage MenuFlare and MenuNotes at the top level of a menu. In thinking about possible front-end implementations of managing a menu, I believe the abstraction can be largely resolved through a separate menu interface and by possibly adding them from the menuItem level. By keeping the notes and flare menu agnostic it would allow for global implementations across different menus like a drink or desert menu. So the top menu is actually just another instance of a sub-menu with no parent.*__


## Class specifications

#### class MenuSticker
* name
  * about: This text is necessary for generating key for icons and food warnings
  * type: String
  * required: yes
* icon
  * about: These could be emojis, daggers, image file names ect...
  * type: string
  * required: yes
* category
  * about: keeping this as text seems like the best option. Through the front end you could make it a quick select option based on unique values, or break them up into different ui elements when managing the list of these. Different menus would have different demands. Without knowing the exact specifications, I am building this in as generic of a way possible.
  * type: string
  * required: yes - this may be overkill for some menus but seems like the best option.

`rails generate model MenuSticker name:string, icon:string, category:string`

    validates :name, presence: true
    validates :icon, presence: true
    validates :category, presence: true
